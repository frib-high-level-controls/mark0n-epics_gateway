This module installs and configures the EPICS Channel Access Gateway.

Note that there is a non-instance specific part which is only needed once for
each host acting as a Channel Access gateway and an instance-specific part
which is needed for each instance of the gateway. The general part can be found
in class epics_gateway whereas epics_gateway::gateway needs to be instantiated
for each gateway instance that should be run on the managed machine.

Examples that require multiple gateway instances on a single machine include:

a) A gateway machine providing access to an accelerator network as well as to
   an experimental network from the office network (three networks).
b) A gateway machine that provides access back and forth between an
   accelerator network and an experimental network (thus acting as a forward
   and reverse gateway).
